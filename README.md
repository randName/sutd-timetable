### Where is my timetable?
Borrowing the often used analogy of functions as factories (and timetables as the products), this is not a factory or the output of the factory; this is merely the blueprint for building a factory.

### That's so dumb! I just want my timetable!
Ok.

### Can I request for new features?
Yes, please check if it's not already in my [todo](#todo), then submit an issue. That is not a guarantee that I will eventually implement it. If you do not have a GitHub account, you will have to find some other way to contact me.

### I found a bug, how do I tell you?
Submit an issue. See above note if you do not have a GitHub account.

### I was late because the timetable was wrong!
Not a question. If you suspect there was a bug that caused it, see the answer to the question above.

## Install
Note: if you are just using the timetable, you don't need to install anything! This is for developing the site.
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
You will need to set up a Firebase account and copy the [authentication configuration](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)
